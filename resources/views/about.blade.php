<h2>Hello fuckers</h2>
<p>

This is app was made for us to have a medium to be able to point fingers and be toxic between us roomates
with all the anonymosity we can. The main purpose is for us to be able to communicate about problems inside
the apartment. Want shit done, and you don't have time to go to their door and talk to them, just add a complain
and they will receive an email saying to please clean their dishes or stop with the loud yelling at 2 am.
